# Heavily modified version of the "message" function from Adafruit's 
# CharLCD code as written for the RaspberryPi LCD Plate. This handles 
# the end of row/line So that it is actually is cut off and does not 
# overflow into the buffer on the 16x2 displays and worse onto 
# line 3 on the 20x4 displays
# 
# All orginal functionality is retained with the addition of handling the
# \n's Cariage returns for all 4 lines on the 20x4
#
# When calling the message function you can add a "mode" variable to the end
# to describe how to handle strings over the length of the display.
#
# MODE:
# 0 or empty = Normal handling as it was from Adafruit
# 1 = Truncates the string right at the display's limit
# 2 = Truncates the string 3 short of the limit and adds an elipse
#
# Future plans will be to both handle proper cariage returns and to 
# cut at the spaces as to not leave partial words.
#
# Orginal was written by Adafruit Industries.  
# Under MIT license.
#
# "This is essentially a complete rewrite, but the calling syntax
# and constants are based on code from lrvick and LiquidCrystal.
